# Report

As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:

# (Question 1)
{% lodash %}
return "Who submitted on or before the deadlines?"
{% endlodash %}


# (Question 2)
{% lodash %}
return "Who(name) has the User ID: 13950166?"
{% endlodash %}


# (Question 3)
{% lodash %}
return "How many people are computer science major?"
{% endlodash %}



# (Question 4)
{% lodash %}
return "How many people submit after deadline?"
{% endlodash %}
